# Dynamic-Course-Sheet
This was an online sheet created using logic programming techniques and Javascript/HTML that keeps track of what classes students at Stanford are taking and their progress towards their degree. I was responsible for using logic programming and prolog to query the inputted information for each student into a database, and then using that information to deduce their progress towards their degree.
